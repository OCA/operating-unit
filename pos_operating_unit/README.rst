This module adds a field "operating unit" in POS with the only goal of restricting visibility (therefore access) to users with same OU allowed.

This also applies to sessions, orders and payments in POS.

A "Point of sale" field is added to orders and payments for clarity.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

In POS config, set operating unit(s) allowed to see this POS.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module only manages visibility of POS and related orders. If a more complete
"pos_operating_unit" is proposed and merged, then it should cover features of this
module which can be discontinued.
