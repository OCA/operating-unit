=======================================
Stock account moves with Operating Unit
=======================================

In the context of perpetual inventory (real time inventory valuation) this
module creates journal entries when stock moves are posted between internal
locations within the same company, but different OU’s.


Configuration
=============

The journal entries will be created only if you have defined the product to
be managed under real-time inventory valuation.


Usage
=====

Create an Internal Transfer between two Locations that belong to different
Operating Units. A journal entry will then be created, where the operating
unit of the source location will be credited for the inventory valuation, at
the product's cost, and the operating unit of the destination location will
be debited.
