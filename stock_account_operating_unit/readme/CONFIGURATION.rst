If your company is required to generate a balanced balance sheet by
operating unit you can specify at company level that operating units should
be self-balanced, and then indicate a self-balancing clearing account.

#. Go to *Settings / Companies / Configuration* and:

   * Set the "Operating Units are self-balanced" checkbox.
   * Set the "Inter-OU Clearing"  account in "Inter-operating unit clearing
     account" field.
#. Assign Operating Unit in Accounts.
