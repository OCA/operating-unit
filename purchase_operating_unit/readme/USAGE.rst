Follow these steps:

#. Use or create a new Operating Unit in Settings -> Users & Companies ->
   Operating Unit (OU)
#. Assign the OU to the User in Settings -> Users & Companies -> Users
#. Create a new Warehouse for the OU in Inventory -> Warehouse Management ->
   Warehouses.
#. Create a new Purchase Order with the OU and confirm it.
#. The OU is propagated to the Stock Picking.
#. After the confirmation, create a new Invoice. The OU is propagated, but you
   have to verify that the Journal has the same OU.
