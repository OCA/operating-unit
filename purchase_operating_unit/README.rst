Usage
=====

#. Create a PO: the Default Operating Unit is assigned to the PO. If you want,
   you can change to another Operating Unit.
#. Validate the PO: the Operating Unit is propagated to the Pickings and
   Invoices.
#. From the invoice, it is not possible to change the Operating Unit, it has to
   be the same as the one of the PO.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Procurement Orders were removed. Procurement Operating Unit module is
deprecated. Stock Operating Unit ensures consistency between the operating unit
from different models.
