# Operating Units

An Operating Unit (OU) is an organizational entity part of a company, 
but that operates as an independent unit. Organizationally, an Operating Unit 
divides a company from a Business/Divisional axis, while Departments divide a 
company from a functional axis perspective.

This repository provides a suite of module to support the Operating Unit concept
across all Odoo processes.
