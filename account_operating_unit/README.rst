===============================
Accounting with Operating Units
===============================

This module introduces the following features:

* Adds the Operating Unit (OU) to the account move line.

* Defines if the Operating Units are self-balanced and Inter-Operating Unit
  clearing account at company level.

* Journal entry with lines in different Operating Units are checked based on
  the "self-balanced" set up in OU.

  At the time of posting the journal entry, the corresponding lines in the
  Inter-Operating Unit clearing account are automatically created, making
  each OU self-balanced.

* The account financial reports include the option to filter by OU.

* Adds the Operating Unit (OU) to the invoice.

* Implements security rules in the invoice based on OU.

Installation
============

No specific installation requirements.

Configuration
=============

If your company is required to generate a balanced balance sheet by
Operating Unit you can specify at company level that Operating Units should
be self-balanced, and then indicate a self-balancing clearing account.

1. Create an account for "Inter-OU Clearing" of type Non-current assets.

2. Go to *Settings / Companies / Configuration* and Set the "Operating Units
   are self-balanced" checkbox.

   Then set the "Inter-OU Clearing"  account in "Inter-Operating Unit
   clearing account" field.

3. Assign Operating Unit in Accounts.


Usage
=====

* Add the Operating Unit to invoices.

* Add the Default Operating Unit to account move. Then all move lines will
  by default adopt this Operating Unit.

* Add Operating Units to the move lines.

  If they differ across lines of the same move, and the OU's are
  self-balanced, then additional move lines will be created so as to make
  the move self-balanced from OU perspective.
