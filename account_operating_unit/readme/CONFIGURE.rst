If your company is required to generate a balanced balance sheet by
Operating Unit you can specify at company level that Operating Units should
be self-balanced, and then indicate a self-balancing clearing account.

#. Create an account "Inter-OU Clearing". It is a balance sheet account.
#. Go to *Settings / Companies / Configuration* and Set the "Operating Units
   are self-balanced" checkbox. Then set the "Inter-OU Clearing"  account in "Inter-Operating Unit
   clearing account" field.
#. Go to *Accounting / Configuration / Accounting / Journals* and define, for
   each Payment Method, the Operating Unit that will be used in payments.
