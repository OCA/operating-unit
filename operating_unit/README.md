Operating Unit
==============
An operating unit (OU) is an organizational entity part of a company, with
separate management ownership. Management by OU is aimed to introduce the
following features:

- Partition data from other OU's.
- Define its own sequencing schemes.
- Administer user access to the data for processing and reporting.
- Is not product or customer specific.
- Provides OU specific P&L and Balance sheet

The current module defines the operating unit entity and the user's security
rules. Other modules extend the standard Odoo apps with the OU.
