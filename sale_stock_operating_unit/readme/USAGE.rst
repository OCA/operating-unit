Follow these steps:

#. Use a created Operating Unit (OU) or create one in Settings ->
   Users&Companies -> Operating
   Units.
#. Use a created Sales Team or create a new one in Sales -> Configuration ->
   Sales Team and assign an OU
#. Create a new Warehouse with the previous OU (or use a Warehouse with an
   assigned OU)
#. Check the Location has the same OU as the Warehouse in Inventory ->
   Configuration Locations (make sure you have Storage Locations checkbox
   activated)
#. Create a new Sale Order with the Sales Team, Operating Unit and Warehouse
   used/created before.
