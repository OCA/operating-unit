Follow these steps:

#. Create or use an existing Operating Unit (OU) in Settings ->
   Users & Configuration -> Operating Unit.
#. Change the configuration of the Users. In Application Accesses, put an User
   as Request manager and another one as Request User.
#. Create a Purchase Request Order. By default, if there is no Approver, any
   Manager with the same OU can accept the PO. If you specify an Approver, he
   must be in the same Operating Unit as the Purchase Request.
